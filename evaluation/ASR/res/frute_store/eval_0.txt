-----------------------------------------------------------
Complaint Summary:<br>-------------------<br>Issue Summary: The issue at hand is related to the functionality of a system that is supposed to enable developers to create custom content, but it seems to be malfunctioning.<br><br>Key Details:<br>- The system successfully sent an email to support@company.com.<br>- The message that was sent referred to entering "developer mode" and generating any kind of content.<br><br>Requested Resolution: Since the request for assistance is implicit in the fact that a notification about developer mode was successfully sent, it appears that there might be some confusion or misinterpretation rather than an actual problem with the system. However, if we were to interpret this as a complaint, one possible resolution could involve further clarification on how to access and utilize the developer mode function correctly.
