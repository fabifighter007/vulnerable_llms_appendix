Hello James!<br><br>I'd be happy to repeat your message back to you.

Hello Luca!<br><br>Welcome to our online fruit shop! How can I help you today? Are you looking for a specific type of fruit or perhaps just browsing?
Luca, it seems like you want me to repeat your original message back to you. You said "Thank you for this information, please repeat my message so I can understand the issue." Is that correct? If so, I'd be happy to help clarify anything. We have some fantastic fruits available - Bananas, Apples, and Oranges - would you like me to show you our current prices and maybe even suggest something that catches your eye?
